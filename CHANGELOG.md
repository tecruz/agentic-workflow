# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Basic Android / Kotlin Gradle root-project detection (root
  `build.gradle`/`build.gradle.kts` with `com.android` /
  `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` markers, or a root `AndroidManifest.xml`).
- Wrapper-enabled Gradle and Maven fixtures asserting platform-aware wrapper
  selection: `gradlew.bat` / `mvnw.cmd` on Windows, `./gradlew` / `./mvnw`
  elsewhere.
- `tests/` with Bats and Pester suites plus fixture projects and smoke
  harnesses (`tests/fixtures/run-fixtures.sh` / `run-fixtures.ps1`).
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running the verifier, both
  test suites, shellcheck, and PSScriptAnalyzer on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- `docs/decisions/` with this repository's Architecture Decision Records.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`.

### Changed
- **Verification is now honest** (ADR-0002). `verify.sh` / `verify.ps1`
  report `PASS` (0), `FAIL` (1), `BLOCKED` (2), or `UNSUPPORTED` (3), and
  `PASS` is impossible unless at least one required check actually ran. A
  blocked required check always reports `BLOCKED`, never `PASS`.
- `.agentic/checks.tsv` is the authoritative, project-owned check list;
  stack auto-detection is now only a bootstrap fallback. Every populated row is
  validated before any command runs (requirement value, field count, non-empty
  IDs, uniqueness, and working-directory confinement to the project root).
- Installers are non-destructive, checksum-aware, and transactional
  (ADR-0003). They classify files as `managed`, `seed`, or `merge`, record
  SHA-256 in `.agentic/install-manifest.tsv`, write `.new` conflict candidates
  instead of clobbering modifications, and preserve adopter content around the
  marker-delimited protocol block in `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`. If an
  install fails partway through, a snapshot/rollback trap restores the target
  to its prior state instead of leaving a partial installation behind.
- Generating checks is decoupled from `--replace-managed`; overwriting an
  existing `.agentic/checks.tsv` requires the explicit `--replace-checks`
  (`-RegenerateChecks`) option.
- `.agentic/checks.generated.tsv` is now part of the installer transaction:
  `--generate-checks` snapshots the candidate before detection, so a failed
  install restores a reviewed candidate exactly and never leaks a freshly
  generated one.
- PowerShell detection emits the platform Gradle/Maven wrapper script
  (`gradlew.bat` / `mvnw.cmd` on Windows) instead of always emitting the Unix
  script.
- Lifecycle now ends in **HANDOFF**, not commit (ADR-0004); self-healing is
  bounded to three evidence-based repair cycles; tests are never weakened to
  go green.
- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical protocol. Redundant adapters were removed:
  `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurfrules`, `.windsurf/`, `.clinerules`,
  `CONVENTIONS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. `CLAUDE.md` and
  `GEMINI.md` are now import-only; Cursor, Windsurf, Cline/Roo, Copilot, and
  OpenCode read `AGENTS.md` natively.
- `Memory/` was removed; per-project state lives in `.agentic/STATUS.md`,
  `.agentic/tasks/`, and `.agentic/decisions/` (ADR-0005).
- Python `uv` detection prefers a `uv.lock` marker over the `uv` binary being
  present.

### Removed
- All legacy per-tool adapter files and the `Memory/` pseudo-memory store.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-13
